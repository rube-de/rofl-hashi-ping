# ROFL Oracle Refactoring Tasks

This document provides a complete checklist of tasks for implementing the ROFL Oracle refactoring plan. Tasks are organized by phase with numbered sections for better tracking.

## Phase 1: Foundation (High Priority)

### 1.1. Configuration System ✅
- [x] Create `src/rofl_oracle/config.py` file
- [x] Implement `SourceChainConfig` dataclass
- [x] Implement `TargetChainConfig` dataclass
- [x] Implement `OracleConfig` main dataclass

### 1.2. Logging Infrastructure ✅
