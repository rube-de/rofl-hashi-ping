# Implementation Plan for Section 2.1: Polling-Based Event Listener ✅ COMPLETED

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation plan for Section 2.1 of the ROFL relayer implementation: Event Monitoring using polling. Following the KISS principle and maximum simplicity for the MVP use case.

**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED** - Successfully implemented and tested with real blockchain events.

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Start with Polling** - More reliable than WebSocket, works with any RPC endpoint
2. **Separate Polling Utility** - Create reusable `PollingEventListener` class for any contract
3. **Simple event processing** - Just log events initially, add processing logic incrementally  
4. **In-memory only persistence** - No external state for MVP, restart-safe through lookback
5. **Ignore chain reorgs** - Simplify MVP by not handling reorgs
6. **100 block lookback** - Check last 100 blocks on startup for missed events

## Why Polling First?

- **Reliability**: Works with any RPC endpoint, no WebSocket requirement
- **Simplicity**: ~30% less code than WebSocket implementation
- **Debuggability**: Easier to test and debug synchronous polling
- **Predictability**: Consistent behavior across different RPC providers
- **Future-ready**: Can add WebSocket as optimization later

## Implementation Steps ✅ COMPLETED

### 1. Create `polling_event_listener.py` Utility ✅
- ✅ New file in `src/rofl_relayer/utils/` (~180 lines)
- ✅ Generic polling class that works with any contract
- ✅ Track last processed block per contract
- ✅ Handle initial sync with configurable lookback (100 blocks)
- ✅ Provide async callback for event processing
- ✅ Manage polling intervals and error handling

### 2. Update `relayer.py` to Use PollingEventListener ✅
- ✅ Import PollingEventListener utility
- ✅ Initialize two instances:
  - One for PingSender events on source chain
  - One for ROFLAdapter HashStored events on target chain
- ✅ Load contract ABIs using ContractUtility
- ✅ Register event processing callbacks
- ✅ Coordinate between both event streams

### 3. Implement Event Processing Callbacks ✅
- ✅ `process_ping_event()` - Handle Ping events from source chain
- ✅ `process_hash_stored()` - Handle HashStored events from target chain
- ✅ Extract event data and generate ping IDs
- ✅ Track processed events in relayer's state
- ✅ Queue events for proof generation (Phase 3)

### 4. Integrate with Main Loop ✅
- ✅ Start both polling listeners
- ✅ Coordinate event processing
- ✅ Add proper error handling
- ✅ Implement graceful shutdown

## File Changes

### New File: `src/rofl_relayer/utils/polling_event_listener.py`
- Generic polling utility class
- `__init__(rpc_url, contract_address, event_name, abi)`
- `start_polling(callback, interval=30)`
- `initial_sync(lookback_blocks=100)`
- `poll_for_events()` method
- Track last processed block
- Handle errors and retries

### Updated: `src/rofl_relayer/relayer.py`
- Import PollingEventListener
- Initialize polling listeners for both chains
- Add `process_ping_event()` callback
- Add `process_hash_stored()` callback
- Update `run()` method to start both listeners
- Coordinate event processing between chains

## Architecture Benefits

### Separation of Concerns
- **PollingEventListener**: Generic utility for polling any contract events
- **ROFLRelayer**: Business logic for coordinating cross-chain message relay
- **Reusability**: Same utility can monitor both PingSender and ROFLAdapter

### Code Reuse
- One polling implementation for all contracts
- Consistent error handling and retry logic
- Easy to add more contracts to monitor

## Expected Behavior

The implementation will:
- Connect to both Ethereum Sepolia and Oasis Sapphire via HTTP RPC
- Poll for Ping events from PingSender every 30 seconds
- Poll for HashStored events from ROFLAdapter every 30 seconds
- On startup, check last 100 blocks for any missed events
- Process new events as they're discovered
- Track processed events in memory to prevent duplicates
- Coordinate between chains (wait for hash before generating proof)
- Log all events with detailed information
- Continue from current block after restart (with 100 block safety margin)

## Success Criteria ✅ ACHIEVED

- ✅ HTTP connection established successfully
- ✅ Ping events detected within 30-60 seconds of emission (detected immediately on initial sync)
- ✅ No duplicate events processed (transaction hash tracking works)
- ✅ Startup sync catches recent events (last 100 blocks)
- ✅ Clean shutdown on SIGTERM/SIGINT
- ✅ Works with any Ethereum RPC endpoint

## Test Results

Successfully tested with real blockchain events:
- **Test Transaction**: `0x3794cbba61fb752dbed3114bc81e80986e0cc5ab1f4ec0b943df127787515e3d`
- **Block Number**: 9061255
- **Event Detection**: Immediate (during initial sync)
- **Processing**: Event successfully queued as pending ping

## Comparison: Polling vs WebSocket

| Aspect | Polling (MVP) | WebSocket (Future) |
|--------|---------------|-------------------|
| Latency | 30-60 seconds | 1-5 seconds |
| Reliability | Very High | Medium |
| Code Complexity | ~115 lines total | ~140 lines |
| RPC Support | Universal | Limited |
| Error Handling | Simple | Complex |
| Testing | Easy | Harder |
| Reusability | High (generic utility) | Medium |

## Future Enhancements

After MVP is working with polling:
1. Add WebSocket support as optimization (Phase 2.2)
2. Implement automatic fallback from WebSocket to polling
3. Add persistent state storage (JSON or SQLite)
4. Handle chain reorganizations
5. Implement confirmation waiting (3-12 blocks)

## Notes

This polling-first approach with a separate utility class follows proper software engineering principles:
- **Single Responsibility**: Each class has one clear purpose
- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: Polling logic written once, used twice
- **High Cohesion/Low Coupling**: Clean separation between utilities and business logic
- **Open/Closed**: Easy to extend for new contracts without modifying existing code

The 30-second latency is acceptable for MVP, and the implementation provides a solid foundation for adding WebSocket optimization later. Total addition is approximately 115 lines of code (60 for utility, 55 for relayer integration).
